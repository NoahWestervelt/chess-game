# chess-game
A chess game written by me and CalebStadler for our Washburn University Capstone Project.

This project features a GUI and network connectivity.

The chess piece images were retrieved from [WikiMedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent) and scaled up to 100 x 100 pixels.

The move notation was implemented as described on [iChess.net](https://www.ichess.net/blog/chess-notation).

The rules for play, as implemented in this chess program, are described on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess).
